As a team, we are excited to introduce our new portal designed specifically for women's health and wellness. With the help of AR guidance and VR meditation, we aim to provide an immersive and engaging experience for women to work out and practice mindfulness. We understand the importance of tracking menstrual cycles, and thus, our portal also includes a period tracking feature that is customized to each woman's unique needs. In addition to this, we also offer tailored health care services to our users.

At the same time, we are committed to empowering women beyond the digital realm. To achieve this, we have included a unique feature where women can design and sell cardboard VR headsets at an affordable cost. This provides an opportunity for women to participate in the tech industry and earn a livelihood while contributing to a sustainable future with our biodegradable pads. Overall, our aim is to create a platform that supports women's health and wellness while also promoting gender equality and environmental sustainability.
